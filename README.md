# Object-Detection-Project
##
# **Problem Statement**
Develop microservice consisting of two main components: a UI backend service and an AI backend service.
The UI end takes the image input from the user. The AI backend utilizes a lightweight open-source model to perform object detection and returns the results in a structured JSON format. 
The two components communicate seamlessly to provide a comprehensive solution to the user.

# **Prerequisites**
To successfully replicate this solution, ensure you have the following installed:
Docker: For containerization of the application.
Python (Flask or FastAPI): For building the backend services.
YOLO: An open-source lightweight model suitable for object detection.
